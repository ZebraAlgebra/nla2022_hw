# üóé Files in this repository

This repository will contain the code files and the terminal, plot screenshots of the code files for nla2022 homework 4 (since NTUCOOL site does not allow `.m` files while the homework requires access to the screenshots and code files).

There will be three types of files:
1. First the iterative linear system solvers required to be implemented by the problems, in the file `solvers`. Corersponding to the name of method implemented in the code file, these includes:
  - `custom_J.m` (Jacobi)
  - `custom_GS.m` (Gauss-Seidal)
  - `custom_GMRES.m` (GMRES)
  - `custom_CG.m` (conjugate gradient)
  - `custom_PCG.m` (preconditioned conjugate-gradient)
  - `custom_GD.m` (gradient descent)
2. The next are the scripts corresponding to each problem that calls the function, in the file `scripts`. Corresponding to the numbering of the problems in the problem set, these includes:
  - For Problem 1: None
  - For Problem 2:
    - `hw4_2(a).m` for Problem 2(a).
    - `hw4_2(b).m` for Problem 2(b).
  - For Problem 3: None
  - For Problem 4:
    - `hw4_4(a).m` for Problem 4(a).
    - `hw4_4(b).m` for Problem 4(b).
    - `hw4_4(c).m` for Problem 4(c).
    - `hw4_4(d).m` for Problem 4(d).
  - For Problem 5:
    - `hw4_5(a).m` for Problem 5.
3. Lastly, there are the code terminal, plot screenshots, in the file `screenshots`. [ADDFILENAMES]
