# üóé Files in this repository

This repository contains the code files and the terminal, plot screenshots of the code files for **nla2022 homework 4** (since NTUCOOL site does not allow `.m` files while the homework requires access to the screenshots and code files).

**Disclaimer** : I didn't finish problem 5 before deadline of this assignment, if there are uploads of scripts or functions for Problem 5, they are all after the deadline; the others listed below are not.

This repository as of 2022.12.04 2155 contains the following files :

1. First the iterative linear system solvers required to be implemented by the problems, in the file `solvers`. Corersponding to the name of method implemented in the code file, these includes:
  - `custom_J.m` (Jacobi)
  - `custom_GS.m` (Gauss-Seidal)
  - `custom_CG.m` (conjugate gradient)
  - `custom_PCG.m` (preconditioned conjugate-gradient)
  - `custom_GD.m` (gradient descent)

To run these functions, these have to be included in the file path settings of MATLAB.
2. The next are the scripts corresponding to each problem that calls the function, in the file `scripts`. Corresponding to the numbering of the problems in the problem set, these includes:
  - For Problem 2:
    - `hw4-2b.m` for Problem 2(b).
  - For Problem 4:
    - `hw4-4ab.m` for Problem 4(a) and 4(b).
    - `hw4_4c.m` for Problem 4(c).
    - `hw4_4d.m` for Problem 4(d).
3. Lastly, there is one folder containing all the plot images generated by these codes.
