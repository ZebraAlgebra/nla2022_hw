# üóé Files in this repository

This repository will contain the code files and the terminal, plot screenshots of the code files for **nla2022 homework 4** (since NTUCOOL site does not allow `.m` files while the homework requires access to the screenshots and code files).

There will be three types of files:
1. First the iterative linear system solvers required to be implemented by the problems, in the file `solvers`. Corersponding to the name of method implemented in the code file, these includes:
  - `custom_J.m` (Jacobi)
  - `custom_GS.m` (Gauss-Seidal)
  - `custom_CG.m` (conjugate gradient)
  - `custom_PCG.m` (preconditioned conjugate-gradient)
  - `custom_GD.m` (gradient descent)
To run these functions, these have to be included in the file path settings of MATLAB.
2. The next are the scripts corresponding to each problem that calls the function, in the file `scripts`. Corresponding to the numbering of the problems in the problem set, these includes:
  - For Problem 2:
    - `hw4-2b.m` for Problem 2(b).
  - For Problem 4:
    - `hw4-4ab.m` for Problem 4(a) and 4(b).
    - `hw4_4c.m` for Problem 4(c).
    - `hw4_4d.m` for Problem 4(d).
3. Lastly, there is one folder containing all the plot images generated by these codes.
